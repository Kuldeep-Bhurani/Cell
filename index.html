                    <h2>Cell Membrane</h2>
                    <p>The cell membrane, also called the plasma membrane, is found in all cells and separates the
                        interior of the cell from the outside environment. The cell membrane consists of a lipid bilayer
                        that is semipermeable. The cell membrane regulates the transport of materials entering and
                        exiting the cell.</p>
                    <img src="./assets/plasma_membrane.jpg" alt="Cell Membrane">
                    <p>The plasma membrane, or the cell membrane, provides protection for a cell. It also provides a
                        fixed environment inside the cell, and that membrane has several different functions. One is to
                        transport nutrients into the cell and also to transport toxic substances out of the cell.
                        Another is that the membrane of the cell, which would be the plasma membrane, will have proteins
                        on it which interact with other cells. Those proteins can be glycoproteins, meaning there's a
                        sugar and a protein moiety, or they could be lipid proteins, meaning that there's a fat and a
                        protein. And those proteins which stick outside of the plasma membrane will allow for one cell
                        to interact with another cell. The cell membrane also provides some structural support for a
                        cell. And there are different types of plasma membranes in different types of cells, and the
                        plasma membrane has in it in general a lot of cholesterol as its lipid component. That's
                        different from certain other membranes from within the cell. Now, there are different plants and
                        different microbes, such as bacteria and algae, which have different protective mechanisms. In
                        fact, they have a cell wall outside of them, and that cell wall is much tougher and is
                        structurally more sound than a plasma membrane is.</p>

                    <h2>Nucleus</h2>
                    <p>A nucleus, as related to genomics, is the membrane-enclosed organelle within a cell that
                        contains the chromosomes. An array of holes, or pores, in the nuclear membrane allows for the
                        selective passage of certain molecules (such as proteins and nucleic acids) into and out of the
                        nucleus.</p>
                    <img src="./assets/Nucleus.jpg" alt="nucleus">
                    <p>The nucleus is one of the most obvious parts of the cell when you look at a picture of the cell.
                        It's in the middle of the cell, and the nucleus contains all of the cell's chromosomes, which
                        encode the genetic material. So this is really an important part of the cell to protect. The
                        nucleus has a membrane around it that keeps all the chromosomes inside and makes the distinction
                        between the chromosomes being inside the nucleus and the other organelles and components of the
                        cell staying outside. Sometimes things like RNA need to traffic between the nucleus and the
                        cytoplasm, and so there are pores in this nuclear membrane that allow molecules to go in and out
                        of the nucleus. It used to be thought that the nuclear membrane only allowed molecules to go
                        out, but now it's realized that there is an active process also for bringing molecules into the
                        nucleus.</p>

                    <h2>Endoplasmic Reticulum</h2>
                    <p>Endoplasmic reticulum is a network of membranes inside a cell through which proteins and other
                        molecules move. Proteins are assembled at organelles called ribosomes. When proteins are
                        destined to be part of the cell membrane or exported from the cell, the ribosomes assembling
                        them attach to the endoplasmic reticulum, giving it a rough appearance. Smooth endoplasmic
                        reticulum lacks ribosomes and helps synthesize and concentrate various substances needed by the
                        cell.</p>
                    <img src="./assets/endoplasmic_reticulum_smooth.jpg" alt="SER">
                    <img src="./assets/endoplasmic_reticulum_rough.jpg" alt="RER">
                    <p>The endoplasmic reticulum can either be smooth or rough, and in general its function is to
                        produce proteins for the rest of the cell to function. The rough endoplasmic reticulum has on it
                        ribosomes, which are small, round organelles whose function it is to make those proteins.
                        Sometimes, when those proteins are made improperly, the proteins stay within the endoplasmic
                        reticulum. They're retained and the endoplasmic reticulum becomes engorged because it seems to
                        be constipated, in a way, and the proteins don't get out where they're suppose to go. Then
                        there's the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, which doesn't have those ribosomes on it. And that
                        smooth endoplasmic reticulum produces other substances needed by the cell. So the endoplasmic
                        reticulum is an organelle that's really a workhorse in producing proteins and substances needed
                        by the rest of the cell.</p>

                        little pieces of fruit floating around in it. And the cytoplasm is the water in the water
                        balloon, and it's a little bit thicker than water, but it makes up the majority of the inside of
                        most cells. Now, inside the cell, inside that water balloon, there's a nucleus and there's other

                        unpronounceable organelles, but the cytoplasm is the ocean in which all of these organelles

                    <p>The Golgi body is a portion of the cell that's made up of membranes, and there's different types
                        of membranes. Some of them are tubules, and some of them are vesicles. The Golgi is located
                        right near the nucleus. It's called a perinuclear body, and it's actually right near the
                        endoplasmic reticulum as well. And when proteins come out of the endoplasmic reticulum, they go
                        into the Golgi for further processing. For example, carbohydrates are put on some of the
                        proteins, and then afterwards these glycoproteins--meaning they have carbohydrate as well as
                        protein on them, these glycoproteins move out of the Golgi to the rest of the cell. And they do
                        so inside other vesicles. Those vesicles are actually made from the Golgi network. In fact, one
                        of the functions of the Golgi is to make new vesicles out of the existing membrane of the Golgi
                        and put into those vesicles the glycoproteins and other substances that are made in the Golgi
                        network. And then those vesicles, filled with the Golgi products, move to the rest of the cell,
                        usually through the cell to the plasma membrane, which is their end destination.</p>

                    <h2>Mitochondrion</h2>
                    <p>Mitochondria are membrane-bound cell organelles (mitochondrion, singular) that generate most of
                        the chemical energy needed to power the cell's biochemical reactions. Chemical energy produced
                        by the mitochondria is stored in a small molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
                        Mitochondria contain their own small chromosomes. Generally, mitochondria, and therefore
                        mitochondrial DNA, are inherited only from the mother.</p>
                    <img src="./assets/mitochondria_0.jpg" alt="Mitochondrion">
                    <p>Mitochondria are membrane-bound organelles, but they're membrane-bound with two different
                        membranes. And that's quite unusual for an intercellular organelle. Those membranes function in
                        the purpose of mitochondria, which is essentially to produce energy. That energy is produced by
                        having chemicals within the cell go through pathways, in other words, be converted. And the
                        process of that conversion produces energy in the form of ATP, because the phosphate is a
                        high-energy bond and provides energy for other reactions within the cell. So the mitochondria's
                        purpose is to produce that energy. Some different cells have different amounts of mitochondria
                        because they need more energy. So for example, the muscle has a lot of mitochondria, the liver
                        does too, the kidney as well, and to a certain extent, the brain, which lives off of the energy
                        those mitochondria produce. So if you have a defect in the pathways that the mitochondria
                        usually functions with, you're going to have symptoms in the muscle, in the brain, sometimes in
                        the kidneys as well; many different types of symptoms. And we probably don't know all of the
                        different diseases that mitochondrial dysfunction causes.</p>

                    <p>A ribosome is an intercellular structure made of both RNA and protein, and it is the site of
                        protein synthesis in the cell. The ribosome reads the messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence and
                        translates that genetic code into a specified string of amino acids, which grow into long chains
                        that fold to form proteins.</p>

                    <p>A ribosome is the cellular machinery responsible for making proteins. There are many ribosomes in
                        each cell, each made up of two subunits. These two subunits lock around the messenger RNA and
                        then travel along the length of the messenger RNA molecule reading each three-letter codon. The
                        ribosome serves as a docking station for the transfer RNA that matches the sequence of bases on
                        the messenger RNA. Each three-letter codon on the messenger RNA pairs with the matching
                        anticodon on a specific transfer RNA, and that specific RNA allows for the addition of a
                        specific amino acid on the end of the growing protein chain. The ribosome then breaks up after
                        the completion of the protein.</p>

                        involved with various cell processes. They break down excess or worn-out cell parts. They may be
                        used to destroy invading viruses and bacteria. If the cell is damaged beyond repair, lysosomes
                        can help it to self-destruct in a process called programmed cell death, or apoptosis.</p>
                    <img src="./assets/lysosome.jpg" alt="Lysosome">
                    <p>Now, the lysosome is a specific type of organelle that's very acidic. So that means that it has
                        to be protected from the rest of the inside of the cell. It's a compartment, then, that has a
                        membrane around it that stores the digestive enzymes that require this acid, low-pH environment.
                        Those enzymes are called hydrolytic enzymes, and they break down large molecules into small
                        molecules. For example, large proteins into amino acids, or large carbohydrates into simple
                        sugars, or large lipids into single fatty acids. And when they do that, they provide for the
                        rest of the cell the nutrients that it needs to... So, for example, if you can't do that, it
                        can't break down large molecules into small molecules. You'll have storage of those large
                        molecules, and this is a disease. There's also another type of lysosome storage disease in which
                        the small molecules that are produced from those large molecules can't get out of the lysosome.
                        They're stored there because the transporters for moving these small molecules out are missing
                        genetically. And finally, one other function of the lysosome is to ingest bacteria so that the
                        bacteria can be destroyed. So the lysosomes also provide a function against infection, and the
                        cell will often engorge a bacterium and put it into its lysosome for destruction. So here's an
                        important organelle that has function against infection and function in a way in nutrition to
                        break down large molecules into small molecules so that they can be reutilized.</p>

                    <h2>DNA</h2>
                    <p>Deoxyribonucleic acid (abbreviated DNA) is the molecule that carries genetic information for the
                        development and functioning of an organism. DNA is made of two linked strands that wind around
                        each other to resemble a twisted ladder — a shape known as a double helix. Each strand has a
                        backbone made of alternating sugar (deoxyribose) and phosphate groups. Attached to each sugar is
                        one of four bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) or thymine (T). The two strands are
                        connected by chemical bonds between the bases: adenine bonds with thymine, and cytosine bonds
                        with guanine. The sequence of the bases along DNA’s backbone encodes biological information,
                        such as the instructions for making a protein or RNA molecule. </p>

                    <p>Is there a more amazing molecule than DNA? It makes each of us who we are. The more scientists
                        understand it, the more we all understand ourselves, one another, and the world around us. For
                        example, did you know that we are all far more alike than we are different? In fact, the DNA
                        from any two people is 99.9% identical, with that shared blueprint guiding our development and
                        forming a common thread across the world. The differing 0.1% contains variations that influence
                        our uniqueness, which when combined with our environmental and social contexts give us our
                        abilities, our health, our behavior. How can one, single molecule contain so much mystery and
                        wonder? We are only beginning to understand the answer to that question, which is what makes the
                        study of DNA so exciting.</p>
